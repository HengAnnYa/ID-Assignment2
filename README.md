Your Project's Name
For our project, we are doing a game website with multiple minigames available for the user to pick from and play. There will be various incentives for them to play, such as leaderboards and a point system for them to unlock rewards. They can also add friends and play with them.

## Design Process
This website is for anyone who likes simple games and want something fun to do in their free time. It can help relieve bordem and also helps them socialise with their friends through friendly competitions to see who can get the best scores. 

User Stories:
- As a young child, I want a fun and easy game to play with my friends. This website helps achieve this by being easy to use with simple games I can easily play and understand.
- As a student, I want a simple game I can play during short free periods I might have between lessons to destress. This website helps achieve that as the games are simple and not addicting, and will not be too distracting from my studies. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- I followed according to youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgU8kg_uFr0) to use lottie animation for the main page.
- The game tic tac toe is refered to a youtube video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3pmT7Cpi24) that show how to create tic tac toe with html, css and js.
- The game tower blocks is refered to a youtube video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqCev8OM1y8\) that show how to make the game with html, css and js.
- The tetris game code is taken from: https://gist.github.com/straker/3c98304f8a6a9174efd8292800891ea1
- The flappy bird game code is taken from w3schools(https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp)
- The nav bar is obtained from bootstrap tutorials(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/)

## Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

- Contact form:
  1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
  2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
  3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
  4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
  5. In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
