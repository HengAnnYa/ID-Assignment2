# ID-Assignment2

Your Project's Name
For our project, we are doing a game website with multiple minigames available for the user to pick from and play. There will be various incentives for them to play, such as leaderboards and a point system for them to unlock rewards. They can also add friends and play with them.

## Design Process
This website is for anyone who likes simple games and want something fun to do in their free time. It can help relieve bordem and also helps them socialise with their friends through friendly competitions to see who can get the best scores. 

User Stories:
- As a young child, I want a fun and easy game to play with my friends. This website helps achieve this by being easy to use with simple games I can easily play and understand.
- As a student, I want a simple game I can play during short free periods I might have between lessons to destress. This website helps achieve that as the games are simple and not addicting, and will not be too distracting from my studies. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- I followed according to youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgU8kg_uFr0) to use lottie animation for the main page.
- The game tic tac toe is refered to a youtube video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3pmT7Cpi24) that show how to create tic tac toe with html, css and js.

## Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

- Sign up form:
  1. Go to the "Sign Up" section under the settings dropdown. The user will be be prompted to make an account and be redirected to a signup sheet. 
  2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
  3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
  4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

- Responsive:
  1. Our navbar is responsive, collapsing into a hamburger dropdown menu on smaller screens and expanding into a full bar on larger screens.
